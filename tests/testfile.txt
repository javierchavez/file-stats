This is a small sample text file.
It only has one (1) paragraph.
If you run the 'wc' command line tool on it,
it will tell you how many lines, words, and characters are contained within the
file.
A word can be delimited by   several   spaces, or even a	tab
or two.		  		     			 		   
Tabs or spaces are only characters, and multiple consecutive tabs and spaces should
be considered as O N E delimiter.
